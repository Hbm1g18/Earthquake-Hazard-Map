                <p1>Growing up in Somerset I had the chance to visit many sites along the Jurassic Coast. During this time I developed a keen interest in fossil hunting, despite never finding much of value. 
                    Seeing these fossilised animals and wondering how they lived stuck with me. Paired with my Grandpa's rock collection and travel tapes, this led to a fascination with how things worked all around the world and a desire to understand science.

                        My current main interest is in tectonic hazards (Volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis). These natural hazards have always been around and wont just disappear. To understand their mechanisms and results is key in mitigating damage
                        and potential harm to life. Seeing such events take place throughout my life, and hearing about those before, surely strengthened my desire to study Geology. <br><br>Out of all the hazards, I am most interested in volcanics because, at the end 
                        of the day, seeing them erupt is just pretty cool. Being able to glimpse deep-rooted processes occuring all across the world is simply incredible. Travelling around has allowed me to see some of these for myself, be it the eggy smelling Solfatara
                        in Italy, or the base of my masters project on the island of Tenerife.

                        Outside of geology I have a long-lasting interest in computers and programming. Starting around the age of 9 to automate tasks on a computer to creating small games. Computers have aided in widening my world-view as well as providing
                        opportunities to learn about things I would have never thought of. In this regard computers have been especially beneficial in learning foreign languages through a wealth of online sources.

                        Interest grew during SOES3002 ('Petroleum Geology and Mineral Resources'), especially in mineral exploration at arc settings. Seeing a link between

                        <br>My main interest was in the formation of porphyry copper deposits at subduction margins.

                        <br><br>During my 3rd year mapping project I worked alongside my mapping partner to ensure safety as well as bouncing ideas off of each other. This was further continued in 4th year mapping of Cornish localities within larger

                        creating reports and delegating roles. Within this project my group achieved a 1st.
                        <br><br>Another 4th year project involved working as a team to conduct an offshore site investigation for a proposed windfarm. Roles were delegated based on specialties as the group was made up of students from differing
